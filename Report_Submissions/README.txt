This folder is for the organization of our drafts for the Group Report.
First Draft is where we can organize our first draft of each group submission prior to bringing them into class the next week.
Second Draft is where we can organize our edited attempts after feedback from Laika. 
Additional draft folders can be created as necessary.

Subfolders to be included will be based on Chapter/Week. We can adjust that based on the pace of the class.
For now, I've updated the Report Draft subfolder to Report_First_Drafts/Ch1


I suggest we try to follow a naming format while making submissions for easier organization once we get around to putting all the groups together.
My recommendation is "[First Name] [Last Name] Part {[Sections]}.[filetype]".
ie. "John Doe Part 1.0.1 1.0.3.docx"
